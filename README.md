# Trybewallet Project
Trybewallet is a web application to manage daily expenses, where you can add, edit and remove an expense.
It was part of my Web Development course at Trybe and the goal was to practice React with Redux, creating a store, reducers, actions, dispatchers, conecting Redux with React components and async actions. Also to practice testing with React Testing Library.
